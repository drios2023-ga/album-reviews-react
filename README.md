# Deploying the project

## Backend Deployment

### Add java.runtime.version=20 to systems.properties file

### Confirm application.properties is in the correct location

Put application.properties fiile in src/main/resource so the app will find it

### Replace spring.datasource.url

In the same file, replace spring.datasource.url (that you used for local user, localhost) with spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL}.

### Deploy the backend

Push all changes to github, then execute git push heroku main. It should build successfully and an app should be created.

### Add postresql add-on

Add this add-on so you have a database to interact with.

## Front End Deployment

### Take the front end url and replace the localhost url in reviews-api.js

### _redirects file

Create a file called _redirects in the Public folder of the front end project and put "/*    /index.html   200" inside of it as the only content (without the quotation marks).

### Deploy to netlify

\- Type npm run build (may need to use sudo)

\- Type npm install netlify-cli -g (may need to use sudo)

\- type netlify deploy (may need to use sudo)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
